## Conventional Commit Messages
What is a `Conventional Commit` ? 
Conventional Commit is A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
